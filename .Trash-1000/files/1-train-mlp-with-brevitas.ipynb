This may be achieved by a mix of techniques, and machine-learning (ML) based techniques are increasing in popularity. \n",

To avoid introducing bottlenecks on the network, the DNN implementation must be capable of detecting malicious ones at line rate, which can be millions of packets per second, and is expected to increase further as next-generation networking solutions provide increased\n",
